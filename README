This project contains a series of simple binaries designed to teach basic
reverse engineering and cracking skills. Challenges are separated by
difficulty, escalating onwards from 0x00.

Each challenge provides a binary and a README explaining the challenge. The
source code is publicly available but should not be used to solve the
challenge.

Build dependencies include:
* GCC or Clang
* Meson
* Ninja

Dependencies include:
* libcurl

Releases can be found on the release page.

Building the exercises can be done from the source directory by running:
